# This is a prototype of microservice for handling bank transactions.

This microservice allows us to handle transactions, set consumption limits, control excess, store and utilize currency exchange data for conversion into USD.
The main purpose of the microservice is to support control over the bank's clients' expenses.

2. Manage spending limits for different categories (goods and services) in USD.
3. Checking transactions for exceeding established limits.
4. Storing and using exchange rate data to convert transaction amounts.
